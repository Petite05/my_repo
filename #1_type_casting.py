# Implicit conversion data is performed automatic by Python compiler: And down hereis the exmp of Explicit conversion which's converted by Developers:

# Casting in python is a process use to convert one data type to another Data:



x = 20
y = 'Hello world'
print(str(x))
print(int(x))
# print(ord()):
print(hex(x))
print(oct(x))
print(tuple(y))
print(set(y))
print(list(y))
# print(dict())



print("Hello world!"); print("Hello world!"); print("Hello") ; print('World')    # we canb use [;] to code different codes in a single line:

x          =                1                     +                     2
print(x)

c,v,n = 10,2,4
print(c)
print(v)
print(n)
